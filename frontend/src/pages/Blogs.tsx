A taxonomic concept is a way of grouping similar taxa together in a database in a more flexible way as compared to specific species names.[9][10][11] Each concept represents a unique biological circumscription and has been assigned a unique alphanumeric ID called Avibase ID. Avibase IDs allow the tracking of congruent taxonomic concepts among publication sources. There are approximately 58,000 unique taxonomic concepts described in Avibase. These include concepts traditionally recognized as species and subspecies, but also other taxonomic groupings (subspecies groups), various alternative taxonomic treatments recognized historically, and other concepts representing hybrids, color morphs and invalid or dubious forms."}
